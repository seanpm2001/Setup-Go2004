# Testing this action

This directory contains tests to make sure the action is working with Go! and not Go. The files are sampled from the [official Go! repository /Tests](https://github.com/fgmccabe/go/tree/master/Tests/) (2004) and the [official Go repository /Tests](https://github.com/golang/go/blob/master/test/fibo.go) (2009)

Until Go! is recognized as a language by GitHub, GitHub is likely going to display the language as Google Go.

The point is to make sure Go is not being recognized as Go! and Go! is not being recognized as Go.
